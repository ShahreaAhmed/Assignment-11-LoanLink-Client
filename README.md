*** LoanLink – Microloan Request & Approval Tracker System

## 📌 Project Overview
LoanLink is a full-stack, web-based microloan request and approval management system designed for small financial organizations, NGOs, and microloan providers.  
The platform enables borrowers to apply for loans, managers to review and approve applications, and admins to manage users, loans, and overall system activities through role-based dashboards.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The main goal of LoanLink is to streamline the complete loan lifecycle—from loan creation and application to approval and tracking—within a single, secure, and user-friendly platform.
